This txt file goes in depth to Mingi Hong's process of setting up authentcation, getting the access token, and getting the email content of the test account.

The test account used was mhub_testacc745@outlook.com.

To summarize, the flow of getting emails from Microsoft goes like this:

1. Authenticate yourself to Microsoft and give your app the account's consent to look through their email, get access token
2. Use the obtained access token to call the Microsoft graph API and get the email content

For step 1, you need to do the following things:

You must:
-Create a microsoft account (any works, I used an outlook email)
-Navigate to microsoft azure; This is a cloud platform management service(?) Basically, allows you to register apps & manage them.
-Register your app, make sure to give access to all users in directories & personal accounts
-set redirect uri to localhost, add a delegate permissions to enable Mail.Read, change authentication setting to enable public flow (unsure if this is truly necessary, I think it is but didn't get a chance to properly test)

Once you've done that, you should have the microsoft azure side of things completely set up. Next on the list is creating the python scripts.

The only thing you'll probably really need is installing msal, which can be achieved with pip install msal.

After that, you can use the get_token template, replacing the client_id and username with the appropriate values (client id is the application id, in azure, and username is your email account).

Run the python file in order to get the access token that you need. The access token should be printed out in the terminal if you're using powershell.

Finally, put the access token into get_email.py and send the request. The request should return all the email contents that are needed for extraction.
